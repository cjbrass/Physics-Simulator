# Physics-Simulator
Project From my college days. Initially built for the linux computers at UBC, I ported it to work on my windows machine.

This works on my machine with Visual Studios 2010 installed, and GLUT and openGL libraries linked.


This code has not been touched since I was in school (2013), so it may not be done amazingly well. But this was easily my favorite project from university, enough so that I added features to it after the class was over. The original was worked on with one of my classmates: Ignacio Rodriguez. The porting, bug fixing, and additional features was done by me.

I have all the Visual Studios project stuff up here, though you can rebuild it all yourself with just the main.cpp file.

I highly doubt I will ever touch this codebase again (even though it was tons of fun, and still needs a lot of work), but I was really proud of it. I could see myself taking this idea, and rebuilding it in some fashion in the future.
